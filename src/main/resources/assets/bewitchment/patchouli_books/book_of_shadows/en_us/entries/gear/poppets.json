That being said, Poppets may also be used by witches who wish to cast voodoo and similar such effects on those who oppose them. Poppets may either be carried on the witch’s person, or placed on a special shelf to keep them safe. Spanish Moss is vital to the creation of Poppets, so a trip to the swamp may be a good idea."
